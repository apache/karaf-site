NB: your local Jekyll installation might need additional modules required by Apache Karaf website. Just run `bundle install` to install these modules.

```
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build
```

```
mvn clean install
```

You can test the war with Jetty embedded and visit http://localhost:8080/ :

```

```
