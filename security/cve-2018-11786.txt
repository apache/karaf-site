CVE-2018-11786: Apache Karaf SSH RBAC security enforcement

Severity: Moderate

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected: all versions of Apache Karaf prior to 4.2.0.M1

Description:

If the sshd service in Karaf is left on so an administrator can manage
the running instance, any user with rights to the Karaf console can
pivot and read/write any file on the file system to which the Karaf
process user has access. This can be locked down a bit by using chroot
to change the root directory to protect files outside of the Karaf
install directory; it can be further locked down by defining a
security manager policy that limits file system access to those
directories beneath the Karaf home that are necessary for the system
to run. However, this still allows anyone with ssh access to the Karaf
process to read and write a large number of files as the Karaf process
user.


This has been fixed in revision:

https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=karaf.git;h=24fb477
https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=karaf.git;h=7ad0da3

Mitigation: Apache Karaf users should upgrade to 4.2.0.M1 or later as soon as possible.
